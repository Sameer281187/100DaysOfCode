About the game:

In this game, a random rectangle is generated with two diagonal (x, y) where (x1, y1) is the lower left coordinate and
(x2, y2) is the upper right coordinate.

Once we have the rectangle generated, we ask user to input a (x, y) coordinate as a guess point that user thinks will lie
within the rectangle

The code evaluates if the point that user guessed lie within the rectangle and lets the user know if the point lies
within the rectangle or not.

The code also depicts a drawing of the rectangle generated and the point placement on a canvas
