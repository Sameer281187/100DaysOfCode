On Day 6, we practiced basic to advanced level problems on website
https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Alone&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Falone.json

There were 5 problems solved
- Hurdle 1
- Hurdle 2
- Hurdle 3
- Hurdle 4
- Maze

The level of difficulty increases with each level and helps understand following concepts

- while loop
- if else within while loop
- Logical thinking
- problem-solving

I would recommend everyone to try out these challenges

Thank you
